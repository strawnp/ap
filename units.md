#### **Optional Units**

Units A and B are optional. The material in these units goes beyond the scope of the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework, but provides a venue for students to gain a deeper appreciation for the computational power of lower-level programming languages and an opportunity to explore data structures and data management techniques.

These fast-track units are designed to come, in the courseâ€™s narrative, between Units 4 and 5. Because these units are strictly optional, no completion timeline is provided and no mapping to the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework is given.
